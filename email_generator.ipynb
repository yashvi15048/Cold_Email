Because we exist to serve athletes, we dare to design the future of sport. To us, innovation is about elevating human potential. We obsess over the needs of athletes of all abilities, using their insights to create products that are beautiful, useful and make all athletes better. To make big leaps, we take big risks. Incremental change won’t get us to where we want to go fast enough. So we pursue moonshots — like developing the first self-lacing shoe, running the first two-hour marathon and committing to 100% renewable energy use in our facilities. We embrace different perspectives — from scientists and designers to coders and quarterbacks — because we know everyone brings unique experiences and ideas to the team. To serve athletes across the hundreds of countries where NIKE does business, we need teams that truly reflect the diversity of our consumers and a culture of inclusivity. We aim to foster inclusion and embrace diversity throughout our business, teams, and culture to create breakthrough innovations, empower teammates to realize their full potential and bring us closer to the communities we serve. NIKE's diverse, high-performing teams around the world are united in purpose and inspired to change the world through sport.\n",

Whether our job is designing the ultimate sneaker or coding a revolutionary app, we’re united by the same mission: to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. \n",
